<h2>Experience</h2>

<p>I have an Experience of 3 years in IT industry and in the skills mentioned in the tech-skills page.<br>
My IT journey has been wavering since day 1 from bad to good and from good to fantastic. I would like 
to proudly mention that, i've welcomed all the good and bad deeds which i came across and never backed
off from any challenge which hung up on my way. Three years might be very short to describe my journey, 
but will weigh a few words of truth, dedication, commitment, hardwork etc.<br>
Over the next few years, i have a vision to start my own IT company plugging in a CEO along my name
and create more jobs for our people. That might gulp in a little time, so lets wait for it!!<br>
I just would like to take you through my experiences in the two organizations in my career.
